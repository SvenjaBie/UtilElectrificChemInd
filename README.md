# UtilElectrificChemInd
This repository contains the code for generating the results published in the research paper "The potential for electrifying industrial utility systems in existing chemical plants". It has been written to model the cost-optimal electrification of existing utility systems for different energy and EU ETS price data and five processes from an ethylene value chain.
